**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**  
In order to develop software that is functional and secure, it's important to design and conduct tests on the software. There are a variety of software testing strategies, techniques, and tools that can be utilized. It's important to test comprehensively and make sure you're testing the functionality of the entire software overall. Testing should take place throughout development and not just at the end. Furthermore, care should be taken during the design and implementation of the software to ensure that all elements of the software are technically sound and follow the best practices of software development. 

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**  
When developing software, it's best to look at the user needs and requirements and break them down into smaller pieces. A feature may seem complex but when broken down, it becomes much more manageable. This also ensures that the software is easier to test and maintain. It's also important to communicate with users when possible to gain a better understanding of their needs. However, you should not blindly trust users, as they do not always understand their needs and the optimal solution. 

**How do I approach designing software?**  
My first goal when designing software is to gain a solid understanding of the project, the users, their needs, and the various use cases by conducting research. Next, refine these ideas into requirements that can be used to design the software. Using the requirements as a guideline, design the software. When developing the software, focus on small chunks of functionality individually. Test your software comprehensively thorough the process.
